# Introduction

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: how to install -->

### Requirements

- [ ] need to have Haskell agda library available
- [ ] can't handle agda compilation option `--cubical-compatible` in certain
  versions?
- [ ] can't actually agda load an agda2hs file, since doesn't recognize some
  options such as `--erase-record-parameters`

### Running `agda2hs`

Suppose you have an agda source file, `<path>/<name>.agda`, somewhere in your
Haskell project. In order to use `agda2hs` to produce the corresponding
`<path>/<name>.hs` file, TODO

<!-- TOOD: figure out how to integrate agda2hs preprocessing into stack build -->
